# Logs_Analysis_Udacity
An internal reporting tool for a newpaper site to discover what kind of articles the site's readers like, by exploring site's database.

## Introduction

This project is a python program that uses psycopg2 module to connect to a database. It explores a large database with over a million rows to draw business conclusions. The database contains newspaper articles, as well as the web server log for the site. The log has a database row for each time a reader loaded a web page.

### The database includes three tables:
* The authors table includes information about the authors of articles.
* The articles table includes the articles themselves.
* The log table includes one entry for each time a user has accessed the site.

### This project drives the following conclusions:
1. Most popular three articles of all time.
2. Most popular article authors of all time.
3. Days on which more than 1% of requests lead to errors.
